# Covid-19 tracker

### About

This is an application to track number of confirmed, recovered and death cases cause by Covid-19.

The application is created by ReactJS with ChartsJS, Material UI, and some different modules. For the server side, I used [this API](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api).

I have deployed the application [here](https://nggbaobkit.github.io/covid-19-tracker/). Feel free to pay a visit. And I hope you guys will enjoy this as much as I do.
